![dummycode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb77f377-c34b-4add-8566-f7d8a55f14b3)

my personal light colourscheme for neovim!

designed to work best with `termguicolors` & `tree-sitter`.

## features
- thoughtful, sensible colour choices
- conservative use of colours; easy for your brain
- the only good light colourscheme ever made
- under 80 columns wide!
- ALMOST white background
- feels like looking at a real paper document!

## installation
1. copy & paste or download alena.lua and save the file as `~/.config/nvim/colors/alena.lua`.
2. run `colorscheme alena` in neovim.
