![dummycode_v2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c328c03f-3efb-4b11-97d7-18ff235efc54)

my personal light colorscheme for neovim!

designed to work best with `termguicolors` & `tree-sitter`.

## features
- thoughtful, sensible color choices
- the only good light colorscheme ever made
- ALMOST white background
- feels like looking at a real paper document!

## installation
1. copy & paste or download alena.lua and save the file as `~/.config/nvim/colors/alena.lua`.
2. run `colorscheme alena` in neovim.
