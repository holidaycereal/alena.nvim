# alena.nvim
![colorscheme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e762057-bd7a-4763-929e-88e101aec285)

my personal light colorscheme for neovim!

designed to work best with `termguicolors` & `tree-sitter`.

## features
- thoughtful, sensible color choices
- very easy to configure
- the only good light colorscheme ever made
- feels like looking at a real paper document!

## installation
1. copy & paste or download alena.lua and save the file as `~/.config/nvim/colors/alena.lua`.
2. run `colorscheme alena` in neovim.
